'''
I have a question that I define a network resnet50 which has the same parameters with the torchvision.models.resnet50,
it's total params and parames size is less than torchvision.models.resnet50
BUT!!! it's Forward/backward pass size and Estimated Total Size is bigger than torchvision.models.resnet50!
you can run the code in this pyfile to watch the question.
