# My own pytorchtools

I want to make a simple tool based on pytorch for myself scientific research.

Now my idea is it can easily achieve classification and segmentation.

Of course, it is also easy to call optimizer or loss_function.

Then,our lab also have a subject Biological information, so i may have to study nlp, and I are interested in GCN,too.

I also will update my project with them.

Later,after I finish most of the this project,I might share my paper notes.

I am a new graduate student who has just started scientific research and I began this project only two days.

So, If you see my project and have any comments or suggestions, please contact me with [e-mail]: 761516971@qq.com
